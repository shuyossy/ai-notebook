AVAILABLE DOCUMENTS:
${documentList}

CHECKLIST REVIEW INFORMATION:
${checklistInfo}

YOUR TASK:
Create an efficient research plan to answer the user's question by identifying:
1. Which documents contain relevant information
2. What specific aspects to investigate in each document
3. How the investigation relates to the review results

STRATEGIC PLANNING GUIDELINES:

**Question Analysis:**
- Understand the user's intent: Are they asking about evaluation reasoning, improvement suggestions, specific document content, or discrepancies in the review?
- Identify keywords and concepts that connect to the checklist items and review comments
- Determine if the question relates to specific checklist items or general document content

**Document Selection Strategy:**
- **Prioritize efficiency**: Select ONLY documents that are likely to contain relevant information
- Use the review results to guide your selection:
  * If asking about a specific evaluation or comment, focus on documents mentioned in those review results
  * If asking about document content, identify which documents are most likely to contain that information
  * Consider the review context: documents with lower ratings or specific comments may need investigation

**Research Instructions Quality:**
- Be SPECIFIC and FOCUSED in your research instructions
- Clearly state what information to extract (e.g., "Find the section describing the testing methodology and extract the specific test types mentioned")
- Connect the research to the review context when relevant (e.g., "Verify the claim in the review comment that the security measures are incomplete")
- Prioritize targeted investigation over broad exploration

**Efficiency Considerations:**
- Minimize the number of documents to investigate (only select what's necessary)
- Avoid redundant investigations across multiple documents unless truly needed
- Focus research instructions on finding specific information rather than general overviews

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
For each document that needs investigation, provide:
- **Document ID**: The exact ID from the available documents list above
- **Research Instructions**: Detailed, focused instructions explaining:
  * What specific information to look for
  * How it relates to the user's question
  * Connection to review results if applicable
- **Reasoning**: Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this document is necessary for answering the question

IMPORTANT:
- Create a focused, efficient plan - quality over quantity
- Your research plan will be executed in parallel across multiple documents
- Each investigation will be conducted independently, so make instructions self-contained and clear`;

3. Research findings from individual document investigations

USER QUESTION:
${userQuestion}

CHECKLIST CONTEXT:
${checklistInfo}

YOUR TASK:
Integrate all research findings and provide a clear, accurate, and comprehensive answer to the user's question.

SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES:

**Understanding the Research Results:**
- You will receive research findings from one or more documents
- Each finding may come from a complete document OR from a portion of a document (chunk)
- Some findings may indicate "information not found in this portion" - this is expected for chunked documents
- Consider ALL findings together to build a complete picture

**Integration Strategy:**
1. **Identify Relevant Information:**
   - Extract key information from each research finding that addresses the user's question
   - Pay attention to specific citations, section references, and evidence provided
   - Distinguish between definitive findings and tentative/partial information

2. **Handle Chunked Document Results:**
   - If research findings mention "chunk X/Y" or "this portion", the document was split for analysis
   - Combine findings from multiple chunks of the same document to form a complete view
   - If some chunks report "information not found", don't assume the information doesn't exist - it may be in other chunks

3. **Resolve Contradictions:**
   - If findings from different sources contradict each other:
     * Present both perspectives
     * Explain the discrepancy clearly
     * Cite specific sources for each perspective
     * Offer reasoning if one source seems more authoritative

4. **Synthesize into a Coherent Answer:**
   - Organize information logically to directly answer the question
   - Connect findings to the review context (evaluations, comments) when relevant
   - Build a narrative that flows naturally, not just a list of findings

**Citation and Reference Guidelines:**
- **Document Names**: Use natural document names without mentioning chunk numbers (e.g., "設計書.pdf" not "設計書.pdf chunk 2/3")
- **Specific Citations**: Include section names, headings, page indicators, or other specific references from the research findings
- **Attribution**: Clearly attribute information to sources (e.g., "設計書.pdfの第3章によると...")
- **Avoid Internal Process Terms**: Do not mention "chunk", "research findings", "investigation" or similar internal process terminology

**Handling Incomplete Information:**
- If critical information is missing or unclear, state this explicitly in Japanese
- Suggest what additional information would be needed
- Distinguish between:
  * Information that definitely doesn't exist in the documents
  * Information that wasn't found but might exist elsewhere
  * Information that is ambiguous or unclear

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- **Language**: Answer in Japanese, matching the style and formality of the user's question
- **Structure**: Organize the answer clearly and logically:
  * Start with a direct answer to the main question if possible
  * Provide supporting details and evidence
  * Conclude with any caveats or additional context
- **Tone**: Professional, informative, and helpful
- **Completeness**: Address all aspects of the user's question
- **Natural Expression**: Write as if you reviewed the documents directly - avoid mentioning the research process

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Your answer represents the final response to the user
- Quality and accuracy are paramount
- Provide value by synthesizing information, not just repeating findings
- Be honest about limitations while maximizing usefulness of available information`;

  return `You are a senior document reviewer specializing in consolidating individual document reviews into comprehensive final assessments.

CONSOLIDATION CONTEXT:
- You are reviewing multiple individual document review results from different parts of a document set
- Each individual review provides detailed analysis of specific document portions
- Your task is to synthesize these individual reviews into a unified, comprehensive assessment
- Some documents may have been split into parts due to length constraints

Checklist items for final evaluation:
${formattedList}

CRITICAL: CHECKLIST ITEM INTERPRETATION
Before assigning ratings, you must carefully analyze the nature and scope of each checklist item to determine its application context:

**Two types of checklist requirements:**
1. **Individual Document Requirements**: Must be satisfied by EACH document separately
   - Examples: "Each section must have a summary", "Every chapter must include references", "All pages must have page numbers"
   - Evaluation approach: Check if ALL documents satisfy the requirement individually

2. **Document Set Requirements**: Must be satisfied by the UNIFIED document set as a whole
   - Examples: "Cover page must include company logo" (only cover page needs this), "Overall document provides complete technical specifications" (assessed across all documents together), "Terminology must be consistent throughout" (consistency across the entire set)
   - Evaluation approach: Check if the requirement is satisfied when considering all documents as ONE integrated document

**Critical thinking process:**
- Read each checklist item carefully and determine which type it is
- Consider the semantic meaning and intent behind the requirement
- Ask yourself: "Does EVERY individual document need to satisfy this, or does the COMPLETE DOCUMENT SET need to satisfy this?"
- When in doubt, consider the practical review scenario: Would a reviewer check this in each document separately, or across the entire set?

CONSOLIDATION INSTRUCTIONS:
${evaluationInstructions}
2. For each item, write a consolidated comment in Japanese following this format:

${actualFormat}

3. Consolidation methodology:
   a) **First**, determine whether each checklist item is an "Individual Document Requirement" or "Document Set Requirement"
   b) Analyze all individual review results for each checklist item
   c) Synthesize findings according to the requirement type:
      - For Individual Document Requirements: Assess if ALL documents satisfy it
      - For Document Set Requirements: Assess if the UNIFIED set satisfies it as a whole
   d) Resolve any apparent contradictions by considering the full context and requirement type
   e) Ensure the final rating reflects the appropriate evaluation scope (individual vs. unified)
   f) Combine evidence from all parts to create comprehensive justification

4. In your consolidated comments, ensure to:
   a) Reference specific sections across ALL reviewed documents/parts using ORIGINAL FILE NAMES
   b) Provide a holistic view that considers the entire document set
   c) Highlight both strengths and weaknesses found across all parts
   d) Give actionable improvement suggestions based on the complete analysis
   e) Write as if you reviewed the complete original document set directly
   f) Always use the original file names when mentioning documents in your consolidated comments
   g) **Do NOT mention** "individual document review", "consolidation", or any internal process terms

5. Rating assignment logic:
   - **Most Important**: Base your rating on the checklist item's requirement type (individual vs. unified)
   - For Individual Document Requirements:
     * If some documents fail while others pass, the overall rating should reflect this mixed state
     * Consider whether the failures are critical or minor
   - For Document Set Requirements:
     * Focus on whether the COMPLETE SET satisfies the requirement
     * Do NOT penalize the set just because one individual document lacks something that another document provides
     * Example: If a checklist asks for "complete technical specifications" and Document A covers hardware while Document B covers software, the SET satisfies the requirement even though each individual document is incomplete
   - Consider the cumulative evidence from all document parts
   - If different parts show varying compliance levels, weigh them according to the requirement type
   - Prioritize the overall ability to meet the checklist criterion in the appropriate scope
   - Document any significant variations between different document sections when relevant

6. Final comment quality standards:
   - Must appear as a natural, comprehensive review of the complete document set
   - Should not reveal the internal consolidation process
   - Should demonstrate thorough understanding of the entire document scope
   - Must read as if a single reviewer examined the entire document set directly
   - Use natural language without internal terminology (avoid "consolidated", "synthesized", "individual document reviews", etc.)
